# Santiago Sanitation Technology Library

The Santiago Sanitation Technology Library characterizes sanitation technologies in a format that can be used directly with
[Santiago](https://github.com/santiago-sanitation-systems/Santiago.jl).
The methodology to establish this library and all data including literature references and assumptions are compiled in the [Sanitation Technology Library documentation](Spuhler_et_al_2023_SANTIAGO_Documentation_and_technology_data_library.pdf).

## Citation
Spuhler, D. Scheidegger, A., Roller, L., Fritzsche, J., Willimann, C., Ilmanen, K. (2022) SANTIAGO documentation and technology library: functionalities, definitions and data for appropriateness profiles and transfer coefficients. Continuously updated URL: https://github.com/SANTIAGO-sanitation-systems/Sanitation-technology-library

## Folders and files
This repository contains :
-  A folder _Documentation_ that contains the _Santiago Sanitation Technology Library Documentation_. The documentation contains:
-- Part A: documents the functionalities and the definitions underlying [_Santiago_](https://github.com/santiago-sanitation-systems/Santiago.jl/tree/a77dec97b3048b53c09a33de8aea7e165f60ef65)
-- Part B: provides a data sheet for all currently implemented technologies presenting all original data used to describe the technology for [_Santiago_](https://github.com/santiago-sanitation-systems/Santiago.jl/tree/a77dec97b3048b53c09a33de8aea7e165f60ef65) as well as literature references and assumptions.
-  A folder _latest_full_example_input_files_ with the latest version of the technology library in the json format and addtional files required by [_Santiago_](https://github.com/santiago-sanitation-systems/Santiago.jl/tree/a77dec97b3048b53c09a33de8aea7e165f60ef65). Refer to the _Santiago Wiki_ for more information about the files and how to use them.
- A folder _bestpractice_example_input_files_ with a realistic but reduced example of the technology library and additional input files for [_Santiago_](https://github.com/santiago-sanitation-systems/Santiago.jl/tree/a77dec97b3048b53c09a33de8aea7e165f60ef65). This is the standard example used by the example documented in the [_Santiago Wiki_](https://github.com/santiago-sanitation-systems/Santiago.jl/wiki).
- The folder _Graphics_ contains graphics as they are used in the _Santiago Wiki_ and can therefore be neglected.

## Download for usage with Santiago

The _latest_ version of the technology library can be downloaded from Julia with
```Julia
date = Dates.today()
    url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/santiago-sanitation-systems/Sanitation-technology-library/master/latest_full_example_input_files       /latest_full_technology_library.json"
    download(url, "input/latest_full_technology_library_$date.json") 
 ```
The _additional_ files can be downloaded from Julia with 
```Julia
# example case
    url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/santiago-sanitation-systems/Sanitation-technology-library/master/latest_full_example_input_files/latest_full_case_input.json"
    download(url, "input/latest_full_case_input_$date.json")

# example inflow masses for user interfaces
    url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/santiago-sanitation-systems/Sanitation-technology-library/master/latest_full_example_input_files/latest_full_inflow_masses.json"
    download(url, "input/latest_full_inflow_masses_$date.json")

# the inflow masses have to be converted to type 'Dict{String,Dict{String,Real}}'
    input_inflow_file = "input/latest_full_inflow_masses_$date.json"
    _input_masses = open(input_inflow_file,"r") do f  
        JSON3.read(f)
    end
    input_masses = Dict(String(k1) => Dict(String(k2) => v2 for (k2, v2) in v1)
                     for (k1,v1) in _input_masses)
    end
```
