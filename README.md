# Santiago Sanitation Technology Library

The Santiago Sanitation Technology Library characterizes sanitation technologies in a format that can be used directly with
[Santiago](https://github.com/santiago-sanitation-systems/Santiago.jl).

## Files
This repository contains the latest version of the technology library, a template for an input case file and a default input masses file as they are used in [_Santiago_](https://github.com/santiago-sanitation-systems/Santiago.jl/tree/a77dec97b3048b53c09a33de8aea7e165f60ef65). Refer to the _Santiago Wiki_ for more information about the files and how to use them. The documentation contains the background information about the functionalities of calculations in _Santiago_ or further information about appropriateness attributes and their calculation. 
The folder "graphics" contains graphics as they are used in the _Santiago Wiki_ and can therefore be neglected.

## Download

The _latest_ version of the technology file can be downloaded from Julia
with
```Julia
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/santiago-sanitation-systems/Sanitation-technology-library/master/technology_library.json"
download(url, "technology_library.json")
```

The input case template can be downloaded with the following code:
```Julia
url_1 = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/santiago-sanitation-systems/Sanitation-technology-library/master/case_input.json"
download(url_1, "input/case_input_template.json")
```
The default input masses file is downloaded and converted as follows:
```Julia
# Download the default input masses file

    url_2 = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/santiago-sanitation-systems/Sanitation-technology-library/master/default_input_masses.json"
    download(url_2, "input/default_input_masses.json")

# read in default_input_masses

    _input_masses = open("input/default_input_masses.json","r") do f
        JSON3.read(f)
    end
# convert to type 'Dict{String,Dict{String,Real}}'
    input_masses = Dict(String(k1) => Dict(String(k2) => v2 for (k2, v2) in v1)
                     for (k1,v1) in _input_masses)
    end
```
